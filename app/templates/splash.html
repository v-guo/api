<h3>A better directory of the student body!</h3>
<p>Yalies is an redesigned version of Yale's official <a href="https://students.yale.edu/facebook">Face Book</a>, which provides contact information for Yale students. It displays the same data that is shown on the Face Book and <a href="https://directory.yale.edu">Yale Directory</a>, but with improved design, user interface, and security.</p>
<p>Yalies was originally developed by <a href="https://erikboesen.com">Erik Boesen</a>. However, it has since became a Yale Computer Society project and is ran collectively by Erik Boeson, Tiger Wang, Lawrence Wang, Yiğit Kılıçoğlu, and Valentina Guo. For questions, comments, bug reports, or suggestions, contact <a href="mailto:erik.boesen@yale.edu">erik.boesen@yale.edu</a>.</p>
